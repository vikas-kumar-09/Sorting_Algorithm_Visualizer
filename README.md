# Sorting Visualizer - Java GUI Project

## Introduction

Sorting Visualizer is a Java-based project that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action using a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It provides an interactive and educational way to understand how different sorting algorithms work by visually demonstrating their step-by-step sorting process.

## Features

- Graphical User Interface (GUI): The project comes with a user-friendly GUI that enables users to interact with the sorting algorithms visually.

- Sorting Algorithms: The visualizer supports a variety of sorting algorithms, including but not limited to:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort

- Real-Time Visualization: Users can observe the sorting algorithms in real-time, as the visualizer animates the sorting process step by step.

- Adjustable Speed: The visualizer allows users to control the speed of the sorting animation, enabling them to slow down or speed up the visualization as per their preference.
